abstract="The study of the relationship and interaction between the work carried out in the academic literature and the requirements of university administrators is essential if ideas generated by research are to benefit every-day users. Conversely, it is crucial that the needs of the timetabling community influence the direction taken by research if high-quality practical solutions are to be produced. A main objective of the work presented here is to provide up-to-date information which will enable researchers to further investigate the area of timetabling research in relation to the generation of robust and flexible techniques which can cope with complexities experienced during implementation in `real world' scenarios. Furthermore, although not discussed here in detail, it is essential, from a commercial perspective, that these developed leading edge techniques are incorporated and used within general applicable timetabling tools. The aim of this paper is to motivate the discussion required to bridge this timetabling gap by bringing timetabling research and educational requirements closer together.",

abstract = {Operational Research (OR) techniques have been applied, from the early stages of the discipline, to a wide variety of issues in education. At the government level, these include questions of what resources should be allocated to education as a whole and how these should be divided amongst the individual sectors of education and the institutions within the sectors. Another pertinent issue concerns the efficient operation of institutions, how to measure it, and whether resource allocation can be used to incentivise efficiency savings. Local governments, as well as being concerned with issues of resource allocation, may also need to make decisions regarding, for example, the creation and location of new institutions or closure of existing ones, as well as the day-to-day logistics of getting pupils to schools. Issues of concern for managers within schools and colleges include allocating the budgets, scheduling lessons and the assignment of students to courses. This survey provides an overview of the diverse problems faced by government, managers and consumers of education, and the OR techniques which have typically been applied in an effort to improve operations and provide solutions.}

abstract = {University timetabling has traditionally been studied as an operational problem where the goal is to assign lectures to rooms and timeslots and create timetables of high quality for students and teachers. Two other important decision problems arise before this can be solved: what rooms are necessary, and in which teaching periods? These decisions may have a large impact on the resulting timetables and are rarely changed or even discussed. This paper focuses on solving these two strategic problems and investigates the impact of these decisions on the quality of the resulting timetables. The relationship and differences between operational, tactical and strategic timetabling problems are reviewed. Based on the formulation of curriculum-based course timetabling and data from the Second International Timetabling Competition (ITC 2007), three new bi-objective mixed-integer models are formulated. We propose an algorithm based on the ϵ-constraint method to solve them. The algorithm can be used to analyze the impact of having different resources available on most timetabling problems. Finally, we report results on how the three objectives – rooms, teaching periods, and quality – influence one another.}

abstract = {The students of the Department of Industrial Design at the TU Eindhoven are allowed to design part of their curriculum by selecting courses from a huge course pool. They do this by handing in ordered preference lists with their favorite courses for the forthcoming time period. Based on this information (and on many other constraints), the department then assigns courses to students. Until recently, the assignment was computed by human schedulers who used a quite straightforward greedy approach. In 2005, however, the number of students increased substantially, and as a consequence the greedy approach did not yield acceptable results anymore. This paper discusses the solution of this real-world timetabling problem. We present a complete mathematical formulation and explain all the constraints resulting from the situation in Eindhoven. We solve the problem using lexicographical optimization with four subproblems. For all four subproblems, an elegant integer linear programming model is given which easily can be put into CPLEX. Finally, we report on our computational experiments and results around the Eindhoven real-world data.}
